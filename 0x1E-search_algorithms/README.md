## 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
# More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- i/n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
#1. Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers
# using the Linear search algorithm
#2. Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of
# integers using the Binary search algorithm
#3. What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an
# array of size n?
#4. What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear
# search algorithm in an array of size n?
#5. What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an
# array of size n?
#6. What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
